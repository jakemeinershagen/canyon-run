"Design":

canyon runner
side scrolling
tile set
hit space to do a jump roll thing to transition from canyon to canyon
ship follows mouse

most of that bs I just said is wrong. this should be a top down game where the ship follows your mouse. we can have loop tracks and start to destination runs. when I say follows your mouse it should be like those drifty car games on mobile that you click in an area and that kind of drags your car that way with some delay.
now to figure out the reward/competition system
maybe it is a time trial system and the time of the other racers is determined afterward to place the player in a reasonable spot. start by determining this manually but eventually you could determine this based on how close they were to the intended tuning for that courses or should I just do manual only for the track mode and then do the tuning idea for some type of in-the-sky drag racing mode. specifically in the atmosphere to justify the different tuning for different tracks. a lore justification could be that you are putting on a show for local denizens.

I should really be better about designing first lol

had to switch rendering mode from forward+ to compatibility. That seems to have gotten rid of some stuttering I was seeing. I don't know why that would have caused and issue. may be worth looking into glaring performance mistakes in the project


todo:

upgrade problems:
	collisions don't work
	thank god [this exists](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/using_tilesets.html#doc-using-tilesets)
		The merge doesn't seem to be working for me. When I try to merge into one I just get a transparent png
